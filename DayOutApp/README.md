 - Title: DayOut iOS App
 
> DayOut app is developed in iOS which helps users in California to find a place that the user can plan on a dayout within his budget. By providing the location and the budget within which the user wants to spend on a day, the app helps user by suggesting all the recreation/tourist attractions around the given location in a span of 200 miles. The app list the top 15 places in the ascending order of the distance to travel so that the user can plan to within this budget. On selecting any of the place, the user can view the current temperature, humidity and wind information. The user can also locate the selected place in map and get to know the distance to be travelled through the Maps app.
